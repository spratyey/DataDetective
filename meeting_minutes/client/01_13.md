Since this was just an introductory meeting, there are no `D` or `T` in particular.

---

### I:
- Self-introductions.
- High hopes as this project will contribute towards the final deployment of the setup.
- Framework, Multiple nodes give info, from various places.
- How do we ensure that all the nodes are giving us valid data?
- How do we take care of specific cases that come up?
- Based on parameters, first step is understanding data.
- Must work on each vertical separately, (for eg: outlier detection)
- Is the data from the nodes independent of the vertical info (if the data's correct/incorrect, emails are sent)
- We can get data from the server via APIs
- We need to develop something to analyze the data in real time (and if erroneous, send an email to someone)
- First suggest idea, then implement idea, then implement sending of mails
- The end goal is to develop a framework to ensure that all the data from the nodes is valid and check if the data is raising any alarms
- Should be reconfigurable (in case of addition of more nodes)
- THe professor is available 10-6 Mon, Wed, Fri (Living Lab)
