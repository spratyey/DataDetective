Since this was just an introductory meeting, there are no `D` or `T` in particular.

### I:
- Always ask your client 'What is the final deliverable'
- Ask: What technologies are we working with?
- Realistically we won't be able to fulfill all the clients requirements. So, make compromises and stuff.
- So have a 'Software Requirements Specifications' doc, to serve as an agreement, do NOT put any extra stuff that we aren't gonna build into it. The team will be graded on whatever is mentioned in the SRS. The SRS is a running document.
- Always keep your client in the loop on what is being done / not being done / make them aware in case some of their demands are unrealistic.
- Take client's consent to record meets, will help with documentation in general. 
- There is also another doc, the 'project concept', which has a basic overview.
